### A brick break game in pygame

I used python 3.11 but it should be able to run in 3.7+

#### Setup
```
# build install pygame from source. install pygbag
pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
alternative
```
# will probably not require building pygame
pip install pygame pygbag 
```

#### Run
```
python main.py
```

#### Run in browser

```

And navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
